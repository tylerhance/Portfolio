# Portfolio of Tyler Hance - Documentation

<h2>Description</h2>

* This is my web developer portfolio showcasing my accomplishments and my most recent projects I've been working on.  

<h2>Design Decisions</h2>

* I built my portfolio site out with simplicity in mind. I wanted to implement simple, clean lines and complimentary colors that help the viewer navigate with ease and not feel overwhelmed with over-complicated themes and colors. I simplified everything and focused more on structure than over-saturating the page with colors and effects.

* I updated my portfolio with the latest project, [Eventine](https://github.com/tylerhance/Eventine). I also refactored the aesthetic look and responsiveness of the webpage.
